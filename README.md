## Background 
Camping invokes different meanings to different people. For the adventurer, it represents a wilderness experience. To a parent, camping is an escape, a family vacation, and inexpensive accommodation.
Since 2020, domestic long-distance travel and overseas travel have been restricted, and camping that combines short-distance, outdoor, social, entertainment and other attributes has rapidly increased.
The American camping culture is mature, and China has great potential. Camping has both leisure and social attributes, and at the same time, the threshold for participation is low, so the participation rate is high
Strong social attributes are the main reason for the rapid development of camping. The convenience of communication in the Internet makes most social interactions online, but more and more people are not satisfied with the more "virtual" social interactions.
From the perspective of facilities, camping still has huge room for development. Camping is very dependent on campsites, and even that is mostly done in parks.
Hong Kong has personnel and geographical advantages for camping.Hong Kong has many mountains and islands, and is rich in both mountainous and marine outdoor resources. Hong Kong retains nearly 75% of its countryside, facing away from the dense forest of concrete buildings.
Hong Kong's country parks are also spread all over Hong Kong, fully accounting for three-quarters of the 1,108 square kilometers of land in Hong Kong.Each country park has also set up different facilities for different users, including family-friendly family trails and educational nature trails.
In Hong Kong, you can enter a country park within an hour's drive from any area, which is rare in the world. It is precisely because of this that Hong Kong is at the forefront of the world in terms of logistics, rescue and security.
